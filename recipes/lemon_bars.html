  <p>Tart, rich and perfection, all rolled into one! Wow your friends with this simple recipe</p>
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>butter</li>
    <li>white sugar</li>
    <li>flour</li>
    <li>eggs</li>
    <li>lemons</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
    <li>In a medium bowl, blend together softened butter, 2 cups flour and 1/2 cup sugar. Press into the bottom of an ungreased 9x13 inch pan.</li>
    <li>Bake for 15 to 20 minutes in the preheated oven, or until firm and golden. In another bowl, whisk together the remaining 1 1/2 cups sugar and 1/4 cup flour. Whisk in the eggs and lemon juice. Pour over the baked crust.</li>
    <li>Bake for an additional 20 minutes in the preheated oven. The bars will firm up as they cool. For a festive tray, make another pan using limes instead of lemons and adding a drop of green food coloring to give a very pale green. After both pans have cooled, cut into uniform 2 inch squares and arrange in a checker board fashion.</li>
  </ol>
